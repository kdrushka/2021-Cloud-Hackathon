    "## Summary  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will access the NASA's Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) version 2 assets, which are archived in cloud optimized geoTIFF (COG) format in the LP DAAC Cumulus cloud space. The COGs can be used like any other geoTIFF file, but have some added features that make them more efficient within the cloud data access paradigm. These features include: overviews and internal tiling. Below we will demonstrate how to leverage these features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### But first, what is STAC?  \n",
    "\n",
    "[SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC)](https://stacspec.org/) is a specification that provides a common language for interpreting geospatial information in order to standardize indexing and discovering data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The [STAC specification](https://stacspec.org/core.html) is made up of a collection of related, yet independent specifications that when used together provide search and discovery capabilities for remote assets.  \n",

    "                                                                                                                  \n",

    "In the following sections, we will explore each of STAC element using NASA's Common Metadata Repository (CMR) STAC application programming interface (API), or [CMR-STAC API](https://github.com/nasa/cmr-stac) for short.  \n",

    "### CMR-STAC API  \n",
    "\n",
    "The [CMR-STAC](https://github.com/nasa/cmr-stac) API is NASA's implementation of the STAC API specification for all NASA data holdings within EOSDIS. The current implementation does not allow for querries accross the entire NASA catalog. Users must execute searches within provider catalogs (e.g., LPCLOUD) to find the STAC Items they are searching for. All the providers can be found at the CMR-STAC endpoint here: <https://cmr.earthdata.nasa.gov/stac/>.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will query the **LPCLOUD** provider to identify STAC Items from the Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2 (HLS) collection that fall within our region of interest (ROI) and within our specified time range.  \n",
